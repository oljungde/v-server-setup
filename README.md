## Description assignment

This document guides you through setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine. You will learn how to configure secure access with an SSH key, disable username and password logins, install the Nginx web server, and link the machine with your GitHub account.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this setup guide, please ensure you have the following in place:

- An **Ubuntu Virtual Machine**: This guide assumes you already have a virtual machine provisioned with a recent version of the Ubuntu Server operating system.
- **Server Credentials**: You must have the initial access details for your server, including:
  - The server's public IP address.
  - A username for an account on the server.
  - The password associated with that user account.
- **Sudo/Root Privileges**: The user account on the server must have sudo privileges to perform administrative tasks, such as installing software and editing system configuration files.
- A **Local Machine with an SSH Client**: You will connect to the server from your own computer. You need a command-line terminal with an SSH client installed. Most modern operating systems (macOS, Linux, and Windows 10/11 via PowerShell or WSL) include an SSH client by default.
- A **GitHub Account**: The final section of this guide requires a GitHub account to configure Git access from the server.

---

## Quickstart

Here you will find a brief description of how to set up a preconfigured VM server with Ubuntu operating system. A detailed description of the individual points can be found in the usage section below

1. First Login and SSH Key Setup:
    - Test the initial login via

      ```bash
      ssh <your_username>@<your_ip>
      ```

    - Generate a new SSH key locally

      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519
      ```

    - Copy the public key to the server using

      ```bash
      ssh-copy-id
      ```

2. Disable Password Login:
    - Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the server.
    - Change `PasswordAuthentication yes` to `PasswordAuthentication no` to disable login with username and password.
    - Restart the SSH service using

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart ssh.service
      ```

3. Install Nginx Web Server:
    - Update the package lists with

      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      ```

    - Install Nginx with

      ```bash
      sudo apt install nginx -y
      ```

    - Check the status with

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl status nginx.service
      ```

4. Configure Nginx for an Alternative Start Page:
    - Create a new HTML file (e.g., alternate-index.html) in the web directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/web/`).
    - Create a new Nginx configuration file under `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` (e.g., web) that points to the new page and a different port (e.g., 8081).
    - Restart Nginx with

      ```bash
      sudo service nginx restart
      ```

5. Set Up Git on the Server:
    - Check if Git is installed,

      ```bash
      git --version
      ```

    - Generate a new SSH key on the VM server with

      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519
      ```

    - Add the public key `~/.ssh/<your_file_name>.pub` to your GitHub account.

## Usage

### <ins>First login to the server and setting up an SSH key</ins>

#### <ins>Test login on the server</ins>

- To test the login on the server, try to log on to the server via ssh with username and password. Open a command line such as `cmd` or `git-bash`. Use the following command to establish a connection to your server:

  ```bash
  ssh <your_username>@<your_ip>
  ```

  Replace `<your_username>` and `<your_ip>` with your actual login data, e.g.:

  ```bash
  ssh jdoe@123.456.789.0
  ```

- For the first time of login you will see a message, that you are unknown for the server. You have to "create" a
fingerprint on the server. If necessary, confirm by entering `yes` in the command shell

  ![fingerprint](./img/fingerprint.png)

- After this you have to authenticate with your password. Now you should see something like this in your command shell:

  ![logged-in](./img/logged_in.png)

- Congratulations, you are logged in! Please open a new local terminal or logout from the server with:

  ```bash
  logout
  ```

#### <ins>Generate a ssh key and deposit it on the server</ins>

#### <ins>SSH key generation</ins>

> [!WARNING]
> To generate a ssh key use a new command line on your <ins>**local machine**</ins>

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

The system will ask you under which file path the new ssh key should be saved. You can also secure the key with a password. If you want to do this, make sure that you keep this password safe. If you want to use a small password, simply confirm with the `Enter` key

- After creating your key, you will see the following in the shell.

  ![create_ssh_key](./img/create_ssh_key.png)

#### <ins>Copy ssh key to VM-Server</ins>

- To copy the generated ssh to your VM use the following command. Make sure you are on your local machine command line:

  ```bash
  # ssh-copy-id -i <path/to/your/key> <user>@<host>

  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/da_cloud_vm_ed25519.pub ojung@116.203.78.54
  ```

- You have to confirm this action by entering your password f√ºr the virtual machine again. After this you will the the
following output in the terminal.

  ![copy_ssh_vm](./img/copy_ssh_vm.png)

- Now, you can login to the cloud machine:

  ```bash
  # ssh -i <~/path/to/key> <user@host>

  ssh -i ~/.ssh/da_cloud_vm_ed25519 ojung@116.203.78.54
  ```

---

### <ins>Deactivate password login</ins>

For security reasons, it is advisable to deactivate the password login on the VM. For example, a password can be cracked
using a brute force attack.

- Make sure, you are logged in to the VM-Server. now editing the ssh config file. To edit this config file administration
right on the VM are needed, so we need a `sudo`in front of the command:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  ```

- The nano editor is opened, now change this line:

  `#PasswordAuthentication yes`

  to

  `PasswordAuthentication no`

- To save the file use `CTRL+S` and close it with `CTRL+X`

- Restart the ssh service with:

  `sudo systemctl restart ssh.service`

- You can check if the ssh service is running with:

  `sudo systemctl status ssh.service`

- The answer from the server should look like this:

  ![restart_ssh](./img/restart_ssh.png)

- You can check if the login with a password is possible with the command:

  ```bash
  # ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <user>@<host>

  ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no ojung@116.203.78.54
  ```

You see something like this?

![no_password_access](./img/no_password_access.png)

Perfect, this is exactly what we want.

### <ins>Webserver configuration with nginx</ins>

A web server delivers static or dynamic files, for example for a web application or a website. nginx is used for this
server, another option would be Apache, for example.

#### <ins>Install nginx</ins>

- To use the VM as a Webserver it is needed to install nginx. First it is recommended to update the installed packages on
the VM. Use:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```

- Install nginx with:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install nginx -y
  ```

- You can then check whether nginx is now running:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status nginx.service
  ```

- You should see an output in your command line like this:

  ![running_nginx](./img/running_nginx.png)

- Now it is possible to check if the web server is running as expectet. Open your browser and enter the IP address of your
Server, e.g. `116.203.78.54`. You the a website like this?

  ![webserver_running](./img/webserver_running.png)

#### <ins>Alternative nginx configuration</ins>

- To see the code of the nginx start page, it is possible zo use the `cat` command on the VM:

  ```bash
  sudo cat /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
  ```

- Now the HTML code of the page is displayed in the command line:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
  <style>
      body {
          width: 35em;
          margin: 0 auto;
          font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
      }
  </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
    <p>
      If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working.
      Further configuration is required.
    </p>

    <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
    <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
    Commercial support is available at
    <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

  You can find this code also [here](./src/index.nginx-debain.html).

- Create a new folder for the alternative start page:

  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /var/www/html/web
  ```

- Create a new empty HTML file. This page wird the new start page for our nginx setup.

  ```bash
  sudo touch /var/www/html/web/alternate-index.html
  ```

- Edit the HTML code of this page with `nano`

  ```bash
  sudo nano /var/www/html/web/alternate-index.html
  ```

  After the edit the code could lock like this:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
  <style>
      body {
          width: 35em;
          margin: 0 auto;
          font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
      }
  </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to this alternate nginx start page!</h1>
    <p>
      If you see this page, the alternate nginx start page is suIf the page is visible, the alternative nginx start
      page has been set up successfully. Further configuration is required to work with this webserver..
    </p>

    <p>For online documentation and support please refer to
    <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
    Commercial support is available at
    <a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

  You can find this code also [here](./src/alternate-index.html)

- Save the file with `CTRL+S` and leave the editor with `CTRL+X`

- Add a new nginx configuration for the enabled sites

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/web
  ```

  Enter the following to this file:

  ```bash
  server {
        listen 8081;
        listen [::]:8081;

        root /var/www/http/alternatives;
        index alternate-index.html;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
  }
  ```

- Restart the nginx service with:

  `sudo service nginx restart`

- Check if the service is restarted an is running with:

  `sudo systemctl status nginx.service`

- If it is desired that the old nginx start page is no longer accessible, it is possible to set up a port forwarding
for the default nginx configuration.

  - Open the default nginx configuration with:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  ```

  - Lock for the `location` entry and add these lines:

  ```bash
  # Port forwarding to 8081
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081
  ```

  - Your file should lock like this:

  ```bash

  # ... some comments and commented out settings above
  server {
          listen 80 default_server;
          listen [::]:80 default_server;

          # SSL configuration
          #
          # listen 443 ssl default_server;
          # listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
          #
          # Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
          # See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
          #
          # Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
          # See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
          #
          # Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
          # Don't use them in a production server!
          #
          # include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

          root /var/www/html;

          # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
          index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

          server_name _;

          location / {
                  # Port forwarding to 8081
                  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081/;
                  # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                  # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                  try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
          }

          # ... some more comments and commented out settings below
  }
  ```

### <ins>Git setup</ins>

- Check if git is installed on the server with `git --version`. You should see something like this in your terminal:

  ![git-version](./img/git-version.png)

- Create a new ssh key on the VM server:

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519
  ```

  Confirm the save path and file name or adjust it according to your wishes. You can also assign a password if you wish. This process
  has already been described above when the ssh key was created for the local machine.

- Open the public ssh key an copy it with `sudo cat ~/.ssh/<your_file_name>.pub`

  > [!WARNING]
  > For security reasons, always use the file with the `.pub` file extension

- Store the ssh key in your github account under `Settings/SSH and GPG keys`

  ![github-ssh](./img/github-ssh.png)

  Now it is possible to work with git on the VM-Server.

---

### <ins>Publication of this documentation as a website</ins>

This was not required to fulfill the task, as an optional extension I decided to make this README available as
index.html via nginx on the server. The HTML code can be found [here](./src/index.html) and the CSS code
[here](./src/styles.css).

- Create new folder `vm-setup` inside the `web` folder

  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /var/www/html/web/vm-setup
  ```

- Navigate to this folder with `cd /var/www/html/web/vm-setup`

- Clone the repository into this folder:

  ```bash
  sudo git clone https://github.com/oljungde/v-server-setup.git .
  ```

- Edit the nginx configuration for web

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/web
  ```

  - Change the file content to:

    ```bash
    server {
      listen 80;
      listen [::]:80;

      server_name _;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8081;

          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      }
    }

    server {
      listen 8081;
      listen [::]:8081;

      root /var/www/html/web;
      index alternate-index.html index.html;

      location / {
          try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
      }
    }
    ```

    - The first server block serves as a reverse proxy and ensures that all requests arriving at port 80 are forwarded to
  port 8081.

    - The second server block is the actual web server configuration, which can be accessed via the proxy.

- Delete the default nginx configuration, otherwise our site would still not be accessible

  ```bash
  sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  ```

- Restart the nginx service with `sudo systemctl restart nginx.service`

- The modified "nginx homepage" is now available at `http://16.203.78.54` and this documentation is available as a
website at `http://16.203.78.54/vm-setup`
